# Tina's Visit to NYC

Tina, I put together a list of recommendations that include restaurants for brunch and bars to stop in for a cocktail! 

**Brunch recommendations**

One of my favorite brunch spots in the city is [Barbounia](https://barbounia.com/). It does not have a view, but it is beautiful and is always a fun scene, especially since it includes $19 unlimited mimosas with brunch! Next, I recommend [Industry Kitchen](https://www.industry-kitchen.com/), it is on the water in South Street, fairly close to the Memorial, with beautiful views of the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges! If you are looking for a more 'wild' brunch, [Bagatelle](http://bagatellenyc.com/about/) is a club scene with loud music and dancing! Lastly, [RH Rooftop Restaurant New York
](https://www.restorationhardware.com/content/category.jsp?context=NewYork) is gorgeous. It is in Restoration Hardware's retail store and has a cool vibe. If you do not go there for brunch, I recommend stopping there for a drink!  

**Drink recommendations**

Since you will be downtown, I recommend stopping in at the [Dead Rabbit](https://www.deadrabbitnyc.com/) for a cocktail. It has consistently ranked as the world's best bar! You will not be disappointed! And if you have some spare time and would like a cocktail with stunning views, I recommend [Mr. Purple](https://www.mrpurplenyc.com) in Hotel Indigo!

Let me know if you have any questions or want addiitonal ideas!
