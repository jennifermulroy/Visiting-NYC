# Tina's Visit to NYC

Tina, here is a list of recommendations that include both brunch and places to stop for a drink and views of the city. 

**Brunch recommendations**
One of my favorite brunch spots is [Barbounia](https://barbounia.com/), it does not have a view, but it is beautiful and is always a fun environment. It includes a $19 unlimited mimosas with brunch! [Bagatelle](http://bagatellenyc.com/about/) is a staple in NYC for wild brunches, it is a club scene if you want dancing and loud music! [RH Rooftop Restaurant New York
](https://www.restorationhardware.com/content/category.jsp?context=NewYork) is gorgeous. It is Restoration Hardware's restaurant inside their retail store. If you do not go there for brunch, I do recommend stopping there for a drink! And lastly, [Industry Kitchen](https://www.industry-kitchen.com/) is on the water in South Street, fairly close to the Memorial, with beautiful views of the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges! 

**Drink recommendations**

Since you will be downtown, I recommend stopping in at the [Dead Rabbit](https://www.deadrabbitnyc.com/) for a cocktial. It has consistently ranked as the best cocktails in the world! You will not be disappointed!
